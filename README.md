**Product Vision**  

The project we as a group have chosen is the Llechfan Hostel Booking System (LHBS) ran by the Talyllyn Railways as a means for volunteers and customers to have accommodation during their stay. The problem with the system currently in place is the lack of a database-backed solution to safely and optimally store and manage any bookings and rooms as well as other overheads that may come with running a booking system for the hostel; with our product implementation we strive to design a new open-source system that can handle any of these requests. This is different from other software such as that already implemented in the system â€“ spreadsheets are currently being used but are hard to understand and process quickly which can lead to misunderstandings and mis-bookings, which our software hopes to remedy by introducing a streamlined management and booking system .The Llechfan Booking system is a solution based on the premise of allowing easy user access of the booking system in order to optimise the letting of rooms through an app interface as well as handle administrative tasks through means of an administrative portal; this portal will be able to deal with applying volunteer discounts as supplied by Talyllyn Railways and other miscellaneous managerial tasks as well as providing a back-end database that will be able to safely store and protect the data of the hostel and its occupants in lines with the relevant Data Protection acts.
