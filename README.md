**Project Vision**

The project we as a group have chosen is the Llechfan Hostel Booking System (LHBS) ran by the Talyllyn Railways as a means for volunteers and customers to have accommodation during their stay. The problem with the system currently in place is the lack of a database-backed solution to safely and optimally store and manage any bookings and rooms as well as other overheads that may come with running a booking system for the hostel; with our product implementation we strive to design a new open-source system that can handle any of these requests. This is different from other software such as that already implemented in the system – spreadsheets are currently being used but are hard to understand and process quickly which can lead to misunderstandings and mis-bookings, which our software hopes to remedy by introducing a streamlined management and booking system .The Llechfan Booking system is a solution based on the premise of allowing easy user access of the booking system in order to optimise the letting of rooms through an app interface as well as handle administrative tasks through means of an administrative portal; this portal will be able to deal with applying volunteer discounts as supplied by Talyllyn Railways and other miscellaneous managerial tasks as well as providing a back-end database that will be able to safely store and protect the data of the hostel and its occupants in lines with the relevant Data Protection acts. 

 

**Risk Plan**

Risk for staff and customers due to Coronavirus  - this can be remedied by sticking to the COVID-19 guidelines set out by the government. 

Data Corruption – Create appropriate measures for back-ups and / or use redundant storage of data to minimize loss during data corruption. 

Miscommunication/Lack of communication – Weekly meetings with the team and working through any issues with the Product Owners and Scrum Masters. 

Double Bookings / Mis-bookings by customers – Remedied by checking against the previous bookings and making the UI and UX streamlined so misunderstandings leading to incorrect bookings are minimized.
